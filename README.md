Burger is a burger logging app using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM.

You will enter the name of a burger, it will display on the screen with a "Devour" button. Once you have devoured the burger it will be deleted from the list and moved to the other side of the screen with all of the other devoured burgers.
